# Program 3: Integrated Knowledge-Based Question Answering

## 📌 Overview
This project implements an advanced question answering system that combines structured text representation with world knowledge and inference. The system can answer questions even when the answer is not explicitly present in the text.

## 🧠 Key Concepts
- Integrated Knowledge
- Scripts (Event Sequences)
- Inference
- Knowledge-Based AI

## 🛠 Technology Used
- Python

## ▶ How to Run
1. Install Python
2. Run the program:
3. Enter a question related to the text.

## 🧪 Example
**Question:** Why couldn't Mary's brother reach her  
**Answer:** Because she wasn't home.

## ⚠ Limitations
- Manually defined knowledge
- Limited reasoning depth
- No learning capability

## 📚 Learning Outcome
- Understanding inference in AI
- Importance of world knowledge
- Difference between data and reasoning
