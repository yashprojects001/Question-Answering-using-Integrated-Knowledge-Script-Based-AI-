| Basic approach              | Direct matching of question patterns with text | Matches structured form of text and question | Uses structured text with world knowledge        |
| Text handling               | Raw text strings                               | Structured internal form                     | Structured + background knowledge                |
| Internal representation     | No internal structure                          | Uses subject–action–object structure         | Uses text structure + scripts                    |
